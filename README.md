# NodeMarket Platform

This front-end is responsible for being the main platform that our user's interact with and is responsible for:

- Facilitating account creation, updates, and deletion.
- Creating and deleting advertisements for advertisers.
  - Advertisers have the ability to add new ads or delete existing ads from their account.
  - Deleting an advertisement stops it from being shared by our promoters.
- Requesting and displaying metrics for promoters and advertisers in a dashboard like view.
  - Promoters can see how many ads their websites are displaying and how many aggregated clicks and impressions their website has driven.
  - Advertisers can see how many ads they have created and how many clicks and impressions each ad has gotten.
